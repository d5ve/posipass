## Description

PosiPass generates multi-word passphrases containing words which have positive
meanings or connotations.

The template is for three or more words to be concatenated together. The first
word is all lowercase, the second word is ALL UPPERCASE, and the third word
uses the standard 'replace vowels with numbers' leetspeek transform. Any
further words continue the pattern starting at step 1 again.

The wordlists from https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
and http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/

I use these passwords for signing up on various websites, and want to balance
the ease of remembering these passwords against their worst-case crackability.

Three-word passwords generally have lengths of 12 characters or more, and won't
fall to the simplest dictionary attacks.

This is security through obscurity, however, as if an attacker knows the
template and the wordlists, then they can easily craft a password cracker to
suit.

Don't use passphrases generated by the default settings for anything important,
as there just isn't enough entropy to be safe.

## Caveats

This application hasn't been audited by anyone who knows anything about
password security.
